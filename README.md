# ðŸ“š Java Learning Repository â€“ For Students

Welcome! This repository is created as part of my journey in learning **Java programming** as a student. It includes exercises, code examples, and notes related to key concepts in Java such as:

- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- âœ… Classes and Objects  
- âœ… Methods and Constructors  
- âœ… Inheritance and Encapsulation  
- âœ… Composition and Polymorphism  
- âœ… Java Basics for academic use

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Repository

- To help review and practice content covered in Java programming courses
- To organize code examples by topic for easy reference
- To understand how to design and structure Java programs using OOP principles
- To practice using **Composition** (has-a relationship) and **Polymorphism** (many forms of behavior)
